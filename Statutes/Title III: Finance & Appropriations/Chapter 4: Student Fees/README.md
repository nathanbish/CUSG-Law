## §3.4.4 – Student Fee Calculation Method  
**Enacted by 83 LCB 10 (2015, “Student Fee Calculation”)**

(a) Student fee calculations shall be conducted as follows:  
> (i) Take the approved CUSG Cost Center Budget as approved by Legislative Council.  
> (ii) Subtract the cost of bonds.  
> (iii) Subtract the estimated revenues for continuing education.  
> (iv) Subtract out predicted interest to be accumulated.  
> (v) Add in fees for police, local schools, childcare, insurance, capital, refunds, waivers, bad debt, and other predicted student fee expenses not included in the CUSG Cost Center Budget.  

(b) To calculate the cost per week to full-fee-paying students to run CUSG cost centers:  
> (i) Use the formula:  
> > (Predicted Fall enrollment × 16)  
> > + (Predicted Spring enrollment × 16)  
> > + (Predicted Summer enrollment × Tier factor)  
> > ÷ Predicted weeks of enrollment  
> (ii) Then divide the result by the predicted weeks of enrollment.  

(c) Multiply this number by 16 and add in the base fee to determine the Fall/Spring semester fee for an individual student.  

(d) To determine the summer fee for an individual student, multiply the weekly fee by the tier factor:  
> Tier 0 (≤ 3 weeks): Factor = 0  
> Tier 1 (> 3 weeks–6 weeks): Factor = 5  
> Tier 2 (> 6 weeks–9 weeks): Factor = 8  
> Tier 3 (> 9 weeks or combination): Factor = 10
