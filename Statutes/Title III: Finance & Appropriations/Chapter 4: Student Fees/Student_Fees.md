# Chapter 4: Student Fees

## §3.4.1 – Doctoral Insurance Exception to Fee Requirement

**Enacted by** 18 EB 24 (1983, “Doctoral Student Insurance Exception”)

**Text:**

Approved doctoral students who wish to purchase university-sponsored insurance shall not be required to pay all standard student fees in order to do so.

## §3.2.3 – Limitation on Student Fee Restrictions

**Enacted by** 32 LCB 16 (1989, Legislative Council Bill)

**Text:**

(b) Any restriction on the spending of CUSG student fees must be contained either:  
> (i) Within this code, or  
> (ii) In the official UCSU/CUSG Student Fee Guidelines.

**Note:**  
This statute references a subsection of the UCSU Bylaws that is no longer identifiable. It is assumed to be part of CUSG law, and the provisions have been codified accordingly. If the Student Fee Guidelines are revised or relocated, cross-references should be updated to preserve enforceability.
