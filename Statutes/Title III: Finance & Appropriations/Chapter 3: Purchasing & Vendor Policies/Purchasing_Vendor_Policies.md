## §3.3.2 – Vendor Preference for Valdez Signatories

**Enacted by** 33 LCB 16 (1990)

**Text:**

(a) A ten percent (10%) price preference shall be established in favor of vendors who are signatories to the Valdez Principles.

> **Note:** This provision originally referenced a recycling policy enacted by 30 LCB 50 (1988), which has since been lost. The operative clause remains codifiable and in effect independently.
