## §4.3.1 – Accessibility Requirements for Event Marketing and Venues  
**Enacted by 96 LCB 07 (2022, “A Campus Accessibility Plan for RSOs”)**  
**Text:**  
(a) All Recognized Student Organizations, Recognized Social Greek Organizations, and other CUSG fee-spending entities must include a clearly labeled accommodation request procedure on all physical or digital marketing materials for student-fee funded events.

(b) Suggested disclaimer language is as follows:  
> “[ORG NAME] and CU Boulder welcome the participation of all interested students. If you require accommodations or have accessibility questions for this event, please contact [ORGANIZER EMAIL] in advance. Requests sent with less than 72 hours notice may not be fulfilled.”

(c) A simplified version of this language or a QR code leading to the accommodation procedure is acceptable, provided the method is clearly labeled and easy to use.

(d) Physical marketing materials smaller than 5”x7” are exempt from this requirement if larger flyers or advertisements are also used to promote the same event.

(e) When hosting an indoor meeting or event, the organizer shall be responsible for knowing the locations of the nearest elevator and accessible building entrance(s).

(f) If an accommodation request is received, the event organizer must contact the University ADA Coordinator and coordinate fulfillment of the request in a timely manner.  
> (i) If the ADA Coordinator or CU Disability Services determines a request is unreasonable, the obligation shall be considered fulfilled.
