# §1.6.1 – Declaration of the Rights of Associated Students  
**Enacted by 88 LCB 07 (2018, “Reaffirming the Rights of Associated Students”)**

(a) The University of Colorado Student Government is, for all intents and purposes, a student union, and may also be referred to as the “Union” or “Association.”

(b) Its members, who are united together as students of the University of Colorado Boulder, by the CU Student Government Constitution, are the Associated Students.

(c) The Associated Students have fundamental rights. It is the Union’s constitutional responsibility to protect and advocate for the rights of all Associated Students, undergraduate and graduate, including but not limited to those guaranteed by applicable Local, State, and Federal law, and those enshrined explicitly or implicitly in the CU Student Government Constitution and its Preamble.

(d) The Associated Students have a right to self-determination; this Union and its Constitution serve as the primary instruments through which that right is exercised.

(e) All Associated Students shall be entitled to the protections that the Union provides. Any agreements made between the University and this Union shall be applied to all Associated Students.

(f) The Union shall collectively represent all Associated Students at the University, Local, State, and Federal levels, and shall advocate for causes and initiatives they find important, for those which improve student life, and against those that are detrimental to student life.

(g) The Union shall also establish, control, and oversee services, programs, and facilities provided to the Associated Students.
