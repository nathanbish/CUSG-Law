# Chapter 3: Executive Branch

## §1.3.1 – Executive Staff Accountability Standards

**Enacted by** 19 ECB 49 (1983, “Executive Operations”)

**Text:**

(a) All UCSU Executive Staff members shall fulfill the duties of their positions to at least a minimal standard, as defined by their respective job descriptions.

(b) Executive Staff members shall submit a bi-weekly time log to the Executive Secretary. The log shall include the time spent and location of work related to their respective duties.

(c) If an Executive Staff member fails to meet these standards, they may be summoned before the UCSU Executive Council to respond to allegations concerning inadequate job performance.


## Removed Statute

**§1.3.2 – State of the Student Union Address**

**Original Enactment:** 51 LCB 06 (1999)  
**Removed:** Repealed by 53 LCB 05  
**Reason for Removal:** Superseded by Bylaws; not independently operative as statutory law.

### Removal Justification:
The statute directed an amendment to the UCSU Bylaws, stating that the State of the Student Union Address would be delivered *“according to the specifications in the UCSU By Laws.”* The legislation did not establish an enforceable legal obligation outside the Bylaws and was not self-executing. As a result, its force is wholly dependent on the continued existence and enforcement of the relevant Bylaw provision. Since codified statutes must stand independently of Bylaw interpretation or dependency, this provision has been removed from the statutory code.


## §1.3.3 – Executive Pay Structure

**Enacted by** 51 LCB 3 (1999)

**Text:**

(a) The pay rate of the UCSU Executives shall be set by Legislative Council each spring before the first hearing of the UCSU Proper budget at Finance Board. The pay rate shall be established through legislation in the form of a secondary measure.

(b) Once the newly elected Executives take office in the spring, they shall receive the same rate of pay as the previous Executives until the end of the fiscal year, June 30.

(c) Upon the change in the fiscal year, July 1, the Executives shall receive the pay rate established by Legislative Council during the immediately previous fiscal year.

(d) During the period of overlap (hereafter called "TRANSITION PERIOD") between the election of the new Executives and the UCSU Constitutional end of the current Executives' term, the newly elected Executives shall receive one half of the amount of salary of the current Executives and the current Executives shall be paid their regular salary.

(e) The Legislative Council President shall send a memorandum to the Student Organizations Finance Office stating the beginning and ending dates of the Executive pay period in accordance with the provisions of this section. The Legislative Council President shall also send a copy of the legislation establishing the pay rate.


## §1.3.4 – Recognition of Executive Branch Bylaws

**Enacted by** 53 LCB 05 (2000)

**Text:**

(a) The Executive Branch shall operate according to the Executive Branch Bylaws.

## §1.3.5 – Diversity Training Requirement for Executives and Executive Staff

**Enacted by** 58 LCB 12 (2003)

**Text:**

(a) The executives and executive staff shall be required to attend diversity training no later than eight weeks after taking office.
