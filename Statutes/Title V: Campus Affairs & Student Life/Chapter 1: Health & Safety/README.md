# Chapter 1: Health & Safety

## §5.1.1 – Non-Cooperation with Federal Immigration Enforcement

**Enacted by** 19ECB12 (1983, “Health & Safety”)

**Text:**

Upon acceptance of sanctuary by guests from El Salvador, Guatemala, or any other country invited to the University of Colorado by professors or student groups for educational purposes, UCSU officials will not assist the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in any efforts of apprehension or investigation of such political refugees.

---

> **Note:** The “INS” referenced in this statute refers to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the federal immigration agency operating under the Department of Justice until its dissolution in 2003, after which its functions were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (primarily ICE, USCIS, and CBP).
>
> UCSU’s refusal to cooperate with INS was not a general rebuke of federal immigration enforcement, but a targeted response to INS policies at the time. The legislative history specifically criticized INS’s violation of international law by refusing to recognize Central American asylum seekers as political refugees, instead reclassifying them as economic migrants — a practice lawmakers viewed as unjust and harmful.
>
> As such, although the statute references INS by name, its protective intent is rooted in opposing federal actions that deny legitimate claims for political asylum by guests invited for educational purposes. This could include contemporary agencies engaged in similar practices if the factual context aligns with that critique.

## §5.1.2 – Publication of Sexual Assault and Harassment Information

**Enacted by** 33 LCB 3 (1990)
